### 🔭 I’m currently working on.. 
improving systems in Node and/or Go at Tata Communications while also building APIs that enable communication between our microservices.  I am also developing interactive user interfaces in React to represent the campaigns' engagement of our customers through intuitive graphs and diagrams. 📈📊
In my freetime I enjoy learning new skills and/or developing applications either on Node or Go or Rust or React or even Python.. always adding something new to the menu! 😊

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on..
Open source projects or any work opportunity related to my background. I can work remotely either from Peru or Italy with no sponsorship required and I am always open to relocate if the role needs it as well. Please feel free to contact me for any collaboration.

### 😂 A fun fact about me..
is that I'm a weightlifting athlete 🏋️ (Gotta work these biceps 💪) so pun incoming..  my life goes from PRs (Pull requests) to PRs (Personal Records). Also I am a big fan of Star Wars. 🌌⚔️
